lua-resty-http - Lua http client driver for the ngx_lua based on the cosocket API

Status
======

This library is considered experimental and still under active development.

The API is still in flux and may change without notice.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a http client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.5.0rc3](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [ngx_openresty 1.0.11.3](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required.

Synopsis
========

    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-http/lib/?.lua;;";

    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                local http = require "resty.http"
                local hc = http:new()

                local ok, code, headers, status, body  = hc:request {
                    url = "http://www.qunar.com/",
                    --- proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
                    --- timeout = 3000,
                    --- headers = { UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/535.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/17.0.963.56 Safari/535.11"}
                }
